## Description

This repository contains Python code for all architectures, pretraining and fine-tuning carried out during the project, as well as dataset examples for downloading and testing. 

- The "train.sh" script provides code to pretrain and fine-tune a Transformer model using a SLURM enviornment.
- The "generate.sh" script provides code to generate protein sequences from a pretrained Transformer model using a SLURM enviornment.
